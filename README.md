# Usage
To see the single run of the model, run:

`python3 hegemons.py`

To see a matplotlib version of the diagrams we put in the paper <https://doi.org/10.1155/2018/9306128> run:

`python3 figures.py`

To generate the figures from scratch, use the `figure_*_data()` functions in figures.py to generate the data, then the `figure_*()` functions to generate the figures.
